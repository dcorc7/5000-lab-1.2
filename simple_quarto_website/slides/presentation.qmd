```{.python code-line-numbers="9-17"}

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = sns.load_dataset("penguins")

# Establishing font size as 18
FS = 18

# Creating the 3 graphs based on penguin islands
my_plot = sns.jointplot(
    data = df,
    x = "flipper_length_mm",
    y = "bill_length_mm",
    hue = "species",
    palette = "Pastel1",
    s = 200
)

# Setting x and y labels
my_plot.set_axis_labels("Penguin flipper length (mm)", "Penguin bill length (mm)", fontsize = FS)

# Increase axis tick size
plt.tick_params(axis = "both", labelsize = FS)
